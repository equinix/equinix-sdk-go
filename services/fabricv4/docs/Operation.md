## Methods

### NewOperation

`func NewOperation() *Operation`

NewOperation instantiates a new Operation object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewOperationWithDefaults

`func NewOperationWithDefaults() *Operation`

NewOperationWithDefaults instantiates a new Operation object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetBgpIpv4RoutesCount

`func (o *Operation) GetBgpIpv4RoutesCount() int32`

GetBgpIpv4RoutesCount returns the BgpIpv4RoutesCount field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetBgpIpv4RoutesCountOk

`func (o *Operation) GetBgpIpv4RoutesCountOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetBgpIpv4RoutesCountOk returns a tuple with the BgpIpv4RoutesCount field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetBgpIpv4RoutesCount

`func (o *Operation) SetBgpIpv4RoutesCount(v int32)`

SetBgpIpv4RoutesCount sets BgpIpv4RoutesCount field to given value.

### HasBgpIpv4RoutesCount

`func (o *Operation) HasBgpIpv4RoutesCount() bool`

HasBgpIpv4RoutesCount returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### GetBgpIpv6RoutesCount

`func (o *Operation) GetBgpIpv6RoutesCount() int32`

GetBgpIpv6RoutesCount returns the BgpIpv6RoutesCount field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetBgpIpv6RoutesCountOk

`func (o *Operation) GetBgpIpv6RoutesCountOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetBgpIpv6RoutesCountOk returns a tuple with the BgpIpv6RoutesCount field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetBgpIpv6RoutesCount

`func (o *Operation) SetBgpIpv6RoutesCount(v int32)`

SetBgpIpv6RoutesCount sets BgpIpv6RoutesCount field to given value.

### HasBgpIpv6RoutesCount

`func (o *Operation) HasBgpIpv6RoutesCount() bool`

HasBgpIpv6RoutesCount returns a boolean if a field has been set.
